# Agricultural Calculator

An interactive web-based calculator designed to help farmers optimize their agricultural practices by calculating Farm Yard Manure (FYM) usage, fodder requirements, and environmental impact assessment. By using the Bajrang Ban and Other Agricultural Practices.

## Features

### 1. Farm Yard Manure (FYM) Calculations

- Land holding and farmer category determination
- Cropping cycle analysis
- Post-harvest residue (PHR) generation estimation
- FYM requirement and generation calculations
- Cost analysis for FYM purchase and composting

### 2. Fodder Calculations

- Dry fodder requirement estimation
- Fodder purchase cost optimization
- Enzyme treatment calculations
- Revenue projections from increased milk yield
- Overall gain analysis

### 3. Impact Analytics

- Overall gain percentage with PHR utilization
- Revenue impact assessment
- Direct GHG emissions avoidance calculation
- Environmental impact analysis
- COâ‚‚ reduction through improved milk yield

### 4. Interactive Help Assistant

- AI-powered chat support using Google's Gemini API
- Instant answers to queries about calculations
- Guidance on sustainable farming practices
- Real-time assistance with using the calculator
